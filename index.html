                    American election system works.</p>
                <p>Current polling has Biden ahead, but 2020 has brought new dynamics such as coronavirus and the
                    increased importance of mail-in ballots. These challenges bring more uncertainty, and with Trump
                    pulling off an unexpected win in 2016, pollsters are wary of underestimating his ability to make a
                    comeback in 2020.</p>

                <p>It took several days for the race to be called, with several close races and the largest turnout in
                    a century. Trump continues to make claims of electoral fraud, mounting lawsuits in the closest
                    states.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Joe Biden has won the Presidential race by obtaining a majority of 306 electoral votes
                    to
                    Donald Trump's 227.</p>

                    are 35 seats up for
