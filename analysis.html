                <p>The Presidential race wasn't called until November 7th, four days after election day. Donald Trump
                    still refuses to concede and continues with legal challenges to vote counts in the closest states.
                </p>
                <p>But while Biden didn't get the landslide that many polls predicted ahead of the election, with all
                    states now called he has won a convincing 306-227 victory in the electoral college.</p>

                <h4>Biden won the electoral college and the popular vote</h4>
                <p>In a year of record turnout, Biden has won more votes than any presidental candidate in history
                    at
                    over 78.7 million. Trump won the second highest with over 73 million.</p>
                <p>In 2016, the importance of the electoral college in winning the Presidency was brought to
                    attention
                    when Hillary Clinton won almost three million more votes than Trump, but failed to surpass the
                    crucial 270 majority of electoral votes.</p>
                <p>Winning without the popular vote is something that only five Presidents have ever done, two in
                    the
                    last five elections with Trump four years ago and Bush in 2000.</p>
                <p>Biden has won convincingly in both the popular vote, with a margin of 3.6%, and the electoral
                    college, with a margin of 13.8%. </p>

            <h4>How Biden won</h4>
            <p>Looking at county-level results, there is evidence of increasing polarisation in the US: counties
                that
                voted for Trump strongly in 2016 generally voted for him by a larger margin in 2020. However, a lot
                of
                support for Biden came from the counties that were won by close margins in 2016.</p>
            <p>For example,...(pick out couple of key counties)...</p>
            <p>Comparing county results to their populations' characteristics also reveals interesting stories from
                the
                2020 results.</p>
            <p>Urban/rural...most Biden gains in suburbs...Education...Trump retained (even gained?) in non-college,
                esp. white non-college, but Biden shifted college grads? Race...lower support among Hispanics for
                Biden
                (compare to exit polls)</p>
            <p>Swing states: same demographic comparisons - Florida latino voters, Georgia, Arizona, blue wall</p>

                <h4>Biden had many paths to victory...</h4>
                <p>Recent elections have generally come down to a few crucial swing states. Polls ahead of the 2020
                    election suggested a much wider electoral map, in which previously reliable Republican
                    strongholds
                    were more competitive.</p>
                <p>Biden had the opportunity to win through various combinations of these ten battleground
                    states. Meanwhile, Trump's path to victory was almost certainly through states with the most
                    electoral votes like Texas and Florida.</p>

                    in a state takes all of that state's electoral votes (besides the exceptions of Maine and
                    Nebraska).
                </p>
                <p>Early on in election night, it looked as though Biden was making significant gains in
                    several of these states, but not quite enough to gain majorities.</p>
                <p>As vote counts progressed, Biden managed to surpass Trump in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan,
                    Wisconsin &
                    Georgia.</p>
                <p>While his narrowed margins in Texas, Ohio & North Carolina provided Biden with no electoral
                    votes,
                    he'd already secured enough to win the Presidency.</p>

                    <p>A <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-015.pdf">recent
                            study</a> showed that normally, mail-in ballots don't particularly favour one party. But
                        2020 is no normal year.</p>
                    <p>Absentee ballots played a much larger role in 2020 than in previous elections, with
                        coronavirus
                        preventing everyone being able to visit polling places safely.</p>
                    <p>Though some skewness was expected - mail-in ballots favouring Biden and on-the-day votes
                        favouring Trump - the extent of this bias wasn't realised until election night.</p>
                    <p>According to....., 1 in ? absentee ballots were votes for Biden.</p>

                    <h4>When can states start counting mail-in ballots?</h4>
                    <p>States have different rules on when they can start counting mail-in ballots. Some changed the
                        rules this year, and many can start opening envelopes and verifying signatures ahead of
                        time,
                        but still the majority of states must wait until election day to start counting.</p>
                    <p>This led to all kinds of different shifts in lead appearing across the country on election
                        night,
                        with partial counts being less reliable as indicators of which way a state would go.</p>

                        Congress -
                        the House and Senate - is what ultimately decides who has power in Washington.</p>

                    <p>The Democrats were hoping for a "blue wave" - Biden winning the Presidency, taking back
                        control
                        of the Senate and retaining - or better expanding - their majority the House.</p>
                    <p>While they did retain control of the House, the Democrat's majority actually narrowed,
                        Republicans flipping back several seats from the 2018 midterms.</p>
                    <p>The Senate is still up for grabs, but having failed to win some crucial toss-ups, the
                        Democrats
                        need both of Georgia's undecided seats to reach a 50-50 split which would be broken in their
                        favour by new VP Kamala Harris.
