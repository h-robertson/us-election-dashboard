            <p>The 2020 election was closer than polls ahead of November 3rd anticipated, with many very close
                races in key battleground states. It took several days to call the races for the Presidency and the
                House of Representatives, while the Senate still hangs in the balance.</p>
            <p>Here's a broad overview of what happened: how Joe Biden won, the ways coronavirus affected vote counts,
                and what the next Congress will look like.</p>

                <h2>What happened in the Presidential race?</h2>
                <p>The Presidential race wasn't called until November 7th, four days after election day. Donald Trump
                    still refuses to concede and continues with legal challenges to vote counts in the closest states.
                </p>
                <p>But while Biden didn't get the landslide that many polls predicted ahead of the election, with all
                    states now called he has won a convincing 306-227 victory in the electoral college.</p>

                <h4>Biden won the electoral college and the popular vote</h4>
                <p>In a year of record turnout, Biden has won more votes than any presidental candidate in history
                    at 79.9 million as of November 25th. Trump won the second highest vote count ever close to 74
                    million.</p>
                <p>In 2016, the importance of the electoral college in winning the Presidency was brought to
                    attention
                    when Hillary Clinton won almost three million more votes than Trump, but failed to surpass the
                    crucial 270 majority of electoral votes.</p>
                <p>Winning without the popular vote is something that only five Presidents have ever done, including
                    Trump in 2016 and Bush in 2000.</p>
                <p>Biden has won convincingly in both the popular vote, with a margin of 3.6%, and the electoral
                    college, with a margin of 13.8%. </p>

            <p>The electoral map looks different in 2020. Classic swing states like Florida, Ohio and Iowa
                have more decisively shifted left, but Biden won the former Republican strongholds of Arizona and
                Georgia.
            </p>
            <p>The Democrats were optimistic about their chances of taking Georgia, with Barack Obama and
                Kamala Harris visiting Atlanta days before the election.</p>
            <p>Many have also put the Democrats' success in Georgia down to grassroots campaigns, like that run by Stacy
                Abrams. Abrams lost out on the position of Governor in 2018 but has continued to fight against voter
                suppression alongside organisations like the <a href="https://newgeorgiaproject.org/">New
                    Georgia Project</a>, helping to register hundreds of
                thousands of new voters in the lead up to this year's election. </p>
            <p>In Arizona, changing demographics are helping shift the state blue, with an overwhelming number of
                internal migrants into Arizona coming from Democratic states like California and Washington.</p>
            <p>In 2020, Georgia and Arizona have both been won with margins of less than half a percent. They could well
                be the new swing states to watch in elections to come.</p>

                <h4>Biden had many paths to victory...</h4>
                <p>Recent elections have generally come down to a few crucial swing states. Opinion polls ahead of the
                    2020
                    election suggested a much wider electoral map, in which previously reliable Republican
                    strongholds
                    were more competitive.</p>
                <p>Biden had the opportunity to win through various combinations of these ten battleground
                    states. Meanwhile, Trump's path to victory was almost certainly through states with the most
                    electoral votes like Texas and Florida.</p>

                <p>Under the electoral college's 'winner-takes-all' system, the candidate who wins the majority of
                    votes
                    in a state takes all of that state's electoral votes (besides the exceptions of Maine and
                    Nebraska).
                </p>
                <p>Early on in election night, it looked as though Biden was making significant gains in
                    several of these states, but not quite enough to gain majorities.</p>
                <p>As vote counts progressed, Biden managed to surpass Trump in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan,
                    Wisconsin &
                    Georgia.</p>
                <p>While his narrowed margins in Texas, Ohio & North Carolina provided Biden with no electoral
                    votes,
                    he'd already secured enough to win the Presidency.</p>

                    <h2>How the votes were counted</h2>
                    <p>A <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-015.pdf">recent
                            study</a> showed that normally, mail-in ballots don't particularly favour one party. But
                        2020 is no normal year.</p>
                    <p>Absentee ballots played a much larger role in 2020 than in previous elections, with
                        coronavirus preventing many people visiting polling places safely.</p>
                    <p>Though some skewness was expected - mail-in ballots favouring Biden and on-the-day votes
                        favouring Trump - the extent of this bias wasn't realised until election night.</p>

                    <h4>When can states start counting mail-in ballots?</h4>
                    <p>States have different rules on when they can start counting mail-in ballots. Some changed the
                        rules this year, some allow processing of envelopes and verification of signatures ahead of
                        time, but still the majority of states must wait until election day to start counting.</p>
                    <p>This led to all kinds of different shifts in lead appearing across the country on election
                        night,
                        with partial counts being less reliable as indicators of which way a state would go.</p>

                    <p>Much of the focus on election night is on the Presidency, but control of the two houses of
                        Congress -
                        the House and Senate - is what ultimately decides who has power in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Only 35 of the 100 Senate seats were up for election, while all 435 seats in the House of

                    <p>The Democrats were hoping for a "blue wave" - Biden winning the Presidency, taking back
                        control
                        of the Senate and retaining - or expanding - their majority in the House.</p>
                    <p>While they did retain control of the House, the Democrat's majority actually narrowed,
                        Republicans flipping back several seats from the 2018 midterms.</p>
                    <p>The Senate is still up for grabs, but having failed to win some crucial toss-ups, the
                        Democrats
                        need both of Georgia's undecided seats to reach a 50-50 split which would be broken in their
                        favour by new VP Kamala Harris.

                    <p>Since 1953, Presidents have only had full control of Congress about a third of the time, and
                        divided governments are becoming more common.</p>
                    <p>Increasing polarisation between Democrats and Republicans means there is less bipartisanship,
                        with representatives generally voting in line with their leaders. Therefore, it is much
                        harder
                        for a President without control of some - or all - of Congress to pass legislation. </p>
